# QuikChek

**Fast, reliable news for Gen Z with real-time misinformation detection**

QuikChek bridges the gap between accessible news consumption and information verification by providing digestible daily news summaries and an on-demand fact-checking tool for social media content.

## Problem We're Solving

Gen Z readers face two critical challenges:
- Traditional news articles are often too dense and time-consuming for mobile-first consumption
- Misinformation spreads rapidly on platforms like TikTok, with limited tools for quick verification

## Our Solution

**Daily News Digest**: Top stories from reputable sources rewritten at an 8th-grade reading level, presented in swipeable mobile-friendly cards with adjustable summary lengths.

**Real-Time Link Verification**: Paste any URL (especially TikTok links) and get instant fact-checking. Our system transcribes audio, extracts claims, cross-references with trusted sources, and returns a detailed truth meter analysis.
